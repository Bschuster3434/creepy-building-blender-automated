units: meters

assumptions:
  - Building is a single-story small commercial / studio structure
  - No interior partitions modeled; exterior shell only
  - Brick is structural masonry with nominal thickness
  - Flat roof with parapet; no visible slope
  - Ground plane is level
  - Door height 2.2m used as scale reference (standard commercial)
  - Windows adjusted to 1.8×1.4m based on photo proportions (appear wider than square)
  - Columns changed to square section per photo evidence
  - Parapet has stepped profile at rear corners (visible in Image 1 and 3)

reconciliation_log:
  - window_size: "Changed from 1.6×1.6m to 1.8×1.4m based on photo proportions"
  - column_shape: "Changed from cylinder to square based on photo evidence"
  - parapet_detail: "Added stepped rear corners visible in photos"
