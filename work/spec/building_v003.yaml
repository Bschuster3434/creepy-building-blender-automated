# Building Specification v003
# Creepy Abandoned Commercial Building - Myrtle Beach Highway
# Generated: 2026-01-02
# Changes from v002:
#   - Fixed parapet corner steps (now 8 corners for L-shape)
#   - Reduced canopy beam dimensions and repositioned
#   - Moved chimney from Y=6.0 to Y=5.25 (more centered)
#   - Increased display window width 2.3m → 2.45m
#   - Increased parapet height 0.70m → 0.80m
#   - Reduced extension depth 3.5m → 3.0m
#   - Minor refinements: foundation, door, chimney height

version: v003
units: meters

assumptions:
  - Entry door height (2.05m) used as primary scale reference for all measurements
  - Standard US modular brick dimensions assumed (200mm x 100mm x 67mm with mortar)
  - L-shaped footprint is original construction (not later addition) based on matching materials and weathering
  - Wall thickness assumes single-wythe brick with interior finish (~0.18m total)
  - Roof has minimal slope (1/4:12 to 1/2:12) for drainage, modeled as flat
  - Small side wall openings are blocked/filled based on visual observation
  - Interior is completely gutted or deteriorated (windows appear pitch black)
  - Canopy posts are Schedule 40 steel pipe (~6-8 inch diameter)
  - All dimensions have ±10-15% uncertainty except directly observable features
  - Building date estimated as 1950s-1960s based on architectural style
  - Coordinate system: front facade faces +Y direction, right side is +X direction
  - L-shaped building has 8 convex corners requiring parapet step treatment

# Rendering guidelines for preserving creepy aesthetic
rendering_notes:
  lighting:
    - "Deep shadows under canopy critical for atmosphere"
    - "Strong contrast between lit and shadowed areas"
    - "Avoid overly bright cheerful lighting"
    - "Consider overcast sky or dramatic lighting"

  materials:
    - "Accurate weathering patterns from reference photos essential"
    - "Non-uniform discoloration creates diseased appearance"
    - "Window darkness (pitch black interior) is defining characteristic"
    - "Rust texture on posts must show organic deterioration"

  geometry:
    - "Preserve L-shape complexity and shadows"
    - "Accurate stepped parapet corners add to architectural strangeness"
    - "Include subtle irregularities - bent posts, settling, sagging"
    - "Deep window reveals create shadow depth"

  context:
    - "Dirt/gravel ground surface preferred over clean pavement"
    - "Vegetation encroachment adds to abandonment aesthetic"
    - "Minimal or no context elements - isolation is key"
    - "Avoid anything that suggests current habitation or maintenance"
