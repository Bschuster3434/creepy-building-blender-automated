# Building Specification v002
# Creepy Abandoned Commercial Building - Myrtle Beach Highway
# Generated from: work/analysis/reference_analysis_001.md
# Date: 2026-01-02
#
# This specification captures the L-shaped single-story brick commercial building
# with its distinctive features: front canopy, stepped parapet corners, and severe
# weathering that contributes to its unsettling appearance.

version: v002
units: meters

assumptions:
  - Entry door height (2.1m) used as primary scale reference for all measurements
  - Standard US modular brick dimensions assumed (200mm x 100mm x 67mm with mortar)
  - L-shaped footprint is original construction (not later addition) based on matching materials and weathering
  - Wall thickness assumes single-wythe brick with interior finish (~0.18m total)
  - Roof has minimal slope (1/4:12 to 1/2:12) for drainage, modeled as flat
  - Small side wall openings are blocked/filled based on visual observation
  - Interior is completely gutted or deteriorated (windows appear pitch black)
  - Canopy posts are Schedule 40 steel pipe (~6-8 inch diameter)
  - All dimensions have ±10-15% uncertainty except directly observable features
  - Building date estimated as 1950s-1960s based on architectural style
  - Coordinate system: front facade faces +Y direction, right side is +X direction

# Rendering guidelines for preserving creepy aesthetic
rendering_notes:
  lighting:
    - "Deep shadows under canopy critical for atmosphere"
    - "Strong contrast between lit and shadowed areas"
    - "Avoid overly bright cheerful lighting"
    - "Consider overcast sky or dramatic lighting"

  materials:
    - "Accurate weathering patterns from reference photos essential"
    - "Non-uniform discoloration creates diseased appearance"
    - "Window darkness (pitch black interior) is defining characteristic"
    - "Rust texture on posts must show organic deterioration"

  geometry:
    - "Preserve L-shape complexity and shadows"
    - "Accurate stepped parapet corners add to architectural strangeness"
    - "Include subtle irregularities - bent posts, settling, sagging"
    - "Deep window reveals create shadow depth"

  context:
    - "Dirt/gravel ground surface preferred over clean pavement"
    - "Vegetation encroachment adds to abandonment aesthetic"
    - "Minimal or no context elements - isolation is key"
    - "Avoid anything that suggests current habitation or maintenance"
