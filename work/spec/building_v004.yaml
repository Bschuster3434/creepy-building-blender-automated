# Building Specification v004
# Creepy Abandoned Commercial Building - Myrtle Beach Highway
# Generated: 2026-01-02
# MAJOR CORRECTIONS from iteration 002 user feedback:
#   - Changed from L-shaped to simple rectangle (15.0m × 8.5m)
#   - Fixed canopy orientation (perpendicular to facade, projecting out)
#   - Reduced canopy posts from 5 to 3
#   - Increased door recess depth (1.4m alcove)
#   - Implemented 3-step descending parapet (front to back)
#   - Removed decorative corner steps (plain corners)
#   - Repositioned chimney to right side parapet wall
#   - Removed back extension (simple 4-wall building)

version: v004
units: meters

assumptions:
  - Entry door height (2.1m) used as primary scale reference for all measurements
  - Standard US modular brick dimensions assumed (200mm x 100mm x 67mm with mortar)
  - Simple rectangular footprint confirmed from overhead Google Maps imagery
  - Wall thickness assumes single-wythe brick with interior finish (~0.18m total)
  - Roof has minimal slope (1/4:12 to 1/2:12) for drainage, modeled as flat
  - Small side wall openings are blocked/filled based on visual observation
  - Interior is completely gutted or deteriorated (windows appear pitch black)
  - Canopy posts are Schedule 40 steel pipe (~6-8 inch diameter)
  - All dimensions have ±10-15% uncertainty except directly observable features
  - Building date estimated as 1950s-1960s based on architectural style
  - Coordinate system: front facade faces -Y direction (toward viewer), right side is +X direction
  - Parapet descends in 3 steps from front to back (stepped roofline)
  - Chimney is integrated with right side parapet wall (not freestanding on roof)

# Rendering guidelines for preserving creepy aesthetic
rendering_notes:
  lighting:
    - "Deep shadows under canopy critical for atmosphere"
    - "Strong contrast between lit and shadowed areas"
    - "Avoid overly bright cheerful lighting"
    - "Consider overcast sky or dramatic lighting"

  materials:
    - "Accurate weathering patterns from reference photos essential"
    - "Non-uniform discoloration creates diseased appearance"
    - "Window darkness (pitch black interior) is defining characteristic"
    - "Rust texture on posts must show organic deterioration"

  geometry:
    - "Simple rectangular footprint - no extensions or complexity"
    - "Stepped parapet creates distinctive side profile"
    - "Plain square corners (no decorative elements)"
    - "Include subtle irregularities - bent posts, settling, sagging"
    - "Deep window reveals create shadow depth"
    - "Deep entrance recess (1.4m) creates shadowed alcove"

  context:
    - "Dirt/gravel ground surface preferred over clean pavement"
    - "Vegetation encroachment adds to abandonment aesthetic"
    - "Minimal or no context elements - isolation is key"
    - "Avoid anything that suggests current habitation or maintenance"
