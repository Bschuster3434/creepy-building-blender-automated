# Building Specification - Phase 1A: Base Structure with Cutouts
# Commercial Building - Myrtle Beach Highway
# Generated: 2026-01-03
# Phase: 1A (Geometry Only)
#
# MAJOR CORRECTIONS from iteration 002 user feedback:
#   - Changed from L-shaped to simple rectangle (15.0m × 8.5m)
#   - Fixed canopy orientation (perpendicular to facade, projecting out)
#   - Reduced canopy posts from 5 to 3
#   - Increased door recess depth (1.4m alcove)
#   - Implemented 3-step descending parapet (front to back)
#   - Removed decorative corner steps (plain corners)
#   - Repositioned chimney to right side parapet wall
#   - Removed back extension (simple 4-wall building)

description: "Phase 1A - Base structure geometry with rectangular cutouts for openings. NO window/door details, NO materials."

assumptions:
  - Entry door height (2.1m) used as primary scale reference for all measurements
  - Standard US modular brick dimensions assumed (200mm x 100mm x 67mm with mortar)
  - Simple rectangular footprint confirmed from overhead Google Maps imagery
  - Wall thickness assumes single-wythe brick with interior finish (~0.18m total)
  - Roof has minimal slope (1/4:12 to 1/2:12) for drainage, modeled as flat
  - Canopy posts are Schedule 40 steel pipe (~6-8 inch diameter)
  - All dimensions have ±10-15% uncertainty except directly observable features
  - Building date estimated as 1950s-1960s based on architectural style
  - Coordinate system: front facade faces -Y direction (toward viewer), right side is +X direction
  - Parapet descends in 3 steps from front to back (stepped roofline)
  - Chimney is integrated with right side parapet wall (not freestanding on roof)
